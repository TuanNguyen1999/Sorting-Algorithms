# Sorting Algorithms

A project that teacher requested us to build and implement 10 sorting algorithms base on 4 states: Sorted, Reversed, Random, Nearly Sorted (78%) and with 6 different sizes:  1.000, 5.000, 10.000, 50.000, 100.000, 250.000.

list of algorithms:
 Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Interchange Sort, Bubble Sort, Shaker Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort

I wrote comparison arrays to DataBase folder and used it for my algorithms.
Results are saved in Statistic folder.
